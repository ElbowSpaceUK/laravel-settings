    "content": "A setting is a class with the following methods, . | The form field for the setting (using the form schema generator) | An array or string of Laravel rules to validate the setting against | A default value | A group. | . Example . &lt;?php use Settings\\Schema\\Setting; class SiteName extends Setting { /** * The default value of the setting. * * @return mixed */ public function defaultValue() { return 'My Site'; } /** * The field schema to show the user when editing the value. * * @throws \\Exception * @return Field */ public function fieldOptions(): \\FormSchema\\Schema\\Field { return \\FormSchema\\Generator\\Field::textInput($this-&gt;inputName())-&gt;setValue($this-&gt;defaultValue()); } /** * Return the validation rules for the setting. * * The key to use for the rules is data. You may also override the validator method to customise the validator further * * @return array */ public function rules(): array|string { return 'string|min:2|max:20'; } /** * @return array */ public static function group(): array { return ['branding', 'appearance']; } } . These classes should extend a setting type such as Settings\\Schema\\UserSetting or Settings\\Schema\\GlobalSetting. Form Field . Form fields are defined using the form schema generator. You can define any field you need here, including complex fields that return objects. The input name for the field is defined in $this-&gt;inputName(), and the default value in $this-&gt;defaultValue() so to define a simple text field you’d use this plus a label/hint/other fields. public function fieldOptions(): \\FormSchema\\Schema\\Field { return \\FormSchema\\Generator\\Field::textInput($this-&gt;inputName())-&gt;setValue($this-&gt;defaultValue()); } . Validation . To ensure the settings entered into the database are valid, you can define rules in the rules array. This can be an array or string of rules, that will validate a valid value. There’s no need to put required/optional rules in, but do include nullable if the option can be null. public function rules(): array|string { return 'string|min:2|max:20'; } . Groups . Groups are a way to order settings to the user. By grouping together similar settings (such as those related to the site theme, authentication, emails etc), it helps users quickly find what they’re looking for. To define a group, define a group function. This should return an array of groups the setting is in. When retrieving a form schema to represent settings, the first group will be taken as the group, and therefore the first group should be the ‘main’ group. public function group(): array { return ['branding', 'appearance']; } . See the integrate section for information about how to add metadata to these. Encryption . The value of all settings are encrypted automatically, since it adds very little overhead. If the data in the setting is not sensitive and you’d rather not encrypt it, set a public $shouldEncrypt property to false in your setting. protected boolean $shouldEncrypt = false; . You can also make the default behaviour be that encryption is not automatic, but can be turned on with $shouldEncrypt = true. To do this, set encryption to false in the config file. Complex data types . All values in the database are automatically serialised to preserve type. This means that arrays and objects will all be saved and retrieved in the correct format, so you don’t have to worry about how your setting is saved. If you want to control how the setting is saved in the database, define castToString and castToValue functions on the setting which will convert your validated setting value to a database-friendly string and back. This example would handle a complex data object, such as something returned from an API client. public function castToString(\\My\\Api\\Result $value): string { return json_encode([ 'id' =&gt; $value-&gt;getId(), 'result' =&gt; $value-&gt;getResult() ]); } public function castToValue(string $value): \\My\\Api\\Result { $value = json_decode($value, true); return new \\My\\Api\\Result($value['id']) -&gt;getResult($value['result']); } .

But a user setting will return a different value depending on which user is logged in. For some sites, the settings will depend on the team a user is in, the module you’re operating in, or the country you’re in. When creating a setting, you can assign it to be of one type. Whenever you then get the value of that setting, it will depend on the model logged in. To create a new type, create an abstract class that implements Settings\\Contracts\\SettingType. You can then use this setting type by extending the new class in your setting. abstract class TeamSettingType implements \\Settings\\Contracts\\SettingType { /** * Get the ID of the currently logged in model (in this case, the team id) * * Returning null will just return the setting value as the default value. * * @return int|null */ public function resolveId(): ?int { if(\\App\\Team\\Resolver::hasCurrentTeam()) { return \\App\\Team\\Resolver::currentTeam()-&gt;id(); } return null; } } .

For setting types like users and teams, where the setting value depends on the session, you can use the same function. This will automatically resolve the current user/team/model from the session and use that. If you do pass an ID in as the first parameter though, it will get the setting value for the given model instead. Aliases . For common settings, you can alias the getters to a single function. Rather than using \\Settings\\Setting::getValue(\\Acme\\Setting\\SiteName::class), you can use \\Settings\\Setting::getSiteName(). By doing this you won’t get IDE typehinting, but it is a more concise way to refer to settings. To alias a setting like this, add it to the config file . &lt;?php return [ 'aliases' =&gt; [ 'SiteName' =&gt; \\Acme\\Setting\\SiteName::class, ... ] ]; . If the setting name is ambiguous (e.g. there’s no other setting with the same name, not including the FQDN), then the alias will be automatically set up. ",
