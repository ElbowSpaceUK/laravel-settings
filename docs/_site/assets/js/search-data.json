The input name for the field is defined in $this-&gt;key(), and the default value in $this-&gt;defaultValue() so to define a simple text field you’d use this plus a label/hint/other fields. When using anonymous settings, hardcode the key and value and just pass the result of the field generator directly to ::create. public function fieldOptions(): \\FormSchema\\Schema\\Field { return \\FormSchema\\Generator\\Field::textInput($this-&gt;key())-&gt;setValue($this-&gt;defaultValue()); } . Fields are currently a required property of any setting, to allow you to dynamically create setting pages. You can learn more about how to integrate your frontend with the form schema in the integrate documentation. Validation . To ensure the settings entered into the database are valid, you can define rules in the rules array. This can be an array or string of rules, that will validate a valid value. There’s no need to put required/optional rules in, but do include nullable if the option can be null. public function rules(): array|string { return 'string|min:2|max:20'; } . Groups . Groups are a way to order settings to the user. By grouping together similar settings (such as those related to the site theme, authentication, emails etc), it helps users quickly find what they’re looking for. To define a group, define a group function. This should return an array of groups the setting is in. When retrieving a form schema to represent settings, the first group will be taken as the group, and therefore the first group should be the ‘main’ group. public function group(): array { return ['branding', 'appearance']; } . See the integrate section for information about how to add metadata to these. Encryption . The value of all settings are encrypted automatically, since it adds very little overhead. If the data in the setting is not sensitive and you’d rather not encrypt it, set a public $shouldEncrypt property to false in your setting. protected boolean $shouldEncrypt = false; . You can also make the default behaviour be that encryption is not automatic, but can be turned on with $shouldEncrypt = true. To do this, set encryption to false in the config file. Anonymous settings use this default behaviour to determine if settings should be encrypted. Complex data types . All values in the database are automatically serialised to preserve type. This means that arrays and objects will all be saved and retrieved in the correct format, so you don’t have to worry about how your setting is saved. If you want to control how the setting is saved in the database, implement the \\Settings\\Contract\\CastsSettingValue interface on your setting. You will need to define a castToString and castToValue functions on the setting which will convert your validated setting value to a database-friendly string and back. This example would handle a complex data object, such as something returned from an API client. public function castToString(\\My\\Api\\Result $value): string { return json_encode([ 'id' =&gt; $value-&gt;getId(), 'result' =&gt; $value-&gt;getResult() ]); } public function castToValue(string $value): \\My\\Api\\Result { $value = json_decode($value, true); return new \\My\\Api\\Result($value['id']) -&gt;getResult($value['result']); } .

If you try to use it before the application is booted, you’ll get an exception.

In the register function of your service provider, define a callback which should be called after the application is booted. This will be called as soon as the application is booted, meaning you can do any service setup here and make use of the settings. The easier option is to register your bindings as a callback, which should only be called once the service is actually requested.
